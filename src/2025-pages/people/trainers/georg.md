Iâ€™m Georg, the maintainer of the widely used Safe, Extensible Rust ORM and Query Builder Diesel. Beside of working on Diesel, I contribute to the Rust ecosystem to resolve problems I encounter while improving Diesel. This includes contributing to the Rust compiler and occasionally contributing to the language design itself. In my day job at GiGa infosystems GmbH, I work as researcher and developer on a database system for 3D-subsurface models.
