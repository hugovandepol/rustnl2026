Are you having to choose between writing your device driver quickly or writing it well?

Fear not! With the device-driver toolkit all this is solved with a bit of codegen.
This talk covers the challenges of macros, manually writing drivers, what this toolkit gets you and how it does it.

I'm Dion Dokter, 28 years old, living in the very east of the Netherlands with my two cats Maya and Lily.
I've been doing embedded Rust for over 5 years now, 3 of which at Tweede golf where I'm the embedded tech lead.
On the job I've worked with a wide range of systems from tiny low power LTE GPS trackers, to satellite firmware, to heat optimizers for New York high-rise buildings.
Musically I play the piano once in a while and like to listen to 00's pop and modern symphonic metal.
