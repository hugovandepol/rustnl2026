"How many Vim shortcuts do you know? What's the most obscure? What's the most useful?

I'll share a few of the forgotten corners of Vim, the features I didn't know about until I had to reimplement them, and some of the things that keep people using this magic."

////// <!-- sepatator between abstract and bio -->

I build delightful tools that make people more productive. Currently building the future of software engineering at Zed. Previously CTO at Superhuman. 

Filer of issues. Fixer of bugs. It has been `NaN` days since last incident.
