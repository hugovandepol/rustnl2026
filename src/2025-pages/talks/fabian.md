This talk explores how Rust powers every layer of our single-photon detectors: from async firmware on microcontrollers with Embassy to auto-generated APIs and user interfaces. We demonstrate practical examples and share benefits and challenges of adopting Rust for scientific instrumentation.

I'm a physicist by training and hold a PhD from MÃ¼nster University in experimental physics. Even though the main focus of my work has been in the research field of quantum sensing / quantum information as well as development and applications of single-photon detectors, I've always been enthusiastic about software development and, since eight years, about Rust, in particular.
