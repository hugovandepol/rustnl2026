Volvo Cars have shipped their first ECU (Electronic Control Unit) fully written in Rust as part of the new SPA2 EV platform. This is the first of its kind in the automotive industry.

Julius will take us through the whole Rust journey at the company, how the project came about and why Rust in cars is a great idea!
