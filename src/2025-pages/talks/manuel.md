An open-source CLI tool written in Rust for managing traces, obtaining
requirements coverage, and analyzing collected trace and coverage data
to generate custom traceability reports. I created mantra as part of my
master's thesis in collaboration with Infineon Technologies AG to support the
certification of their embedded Rust projects against Automotive SPICE. In
addition to this focus on safety-critical Rust projects, the tool is generally
designed to work with any programming language in any domain to improve product
quality and developer collaboration.

My name is Manuel Hatzl, and I recently joined Ferrous Systems as a tooling
engineer. Before that I studied Software Engineering in the joint graduate
programme of the University of Augsburg, the Technical University of Munich, and
the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich.
