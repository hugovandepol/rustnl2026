For Rust to be as fast as people need, we need to look beyond "how fast is
rustc". I'll step through an end-user focused framing of performance,
things we learned talking to developers of large applications, and
explore why a cross-team performance roadmap will benefit the project.
This will lead into brainstorming and roadmapping during the All Hands.
