In a classic case of "Rewrite It In Rust", implementing a novel
algorithm for identifying binding sites in DNA led to a 100x improvement in 
speed. This talk emphasizes on *what* made it easier with Rust compared
to C & C++, which are still in use predominantly in high-performance bioinformatics.

Martin is a PhD student in Bioinformatics, originally from Paris. After starting his PhD at [EMBL](https://www.embl.org/) in Heidelberg in 2019, in co-supervision with [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), he moved to the [Leiden University Medical Center in 2024](https://www.lumc.nl/en/).
Molecular Biologist and Computer Scientist by training, he used part of his PhD to write Python APIs for legacy C and C++ scientific code ([PyHMMER](https://github.com/althonos/pyhmmer), [Pyrodigal](https://github.com/althonos/pyrodigal)), as well as new implementations for high-performance computing problems, where Rust is gaining traction.
When he's not writing code or research papers, he plays the bass and the guitar for a solo post-punk project.
