Performance matters â€” but achieving reproducible performance is harder than
it first appears, especially in cloud environments where hardware variability
is common. Modern systems introduce unpredictable factors that can make
traditional benchmarking noisy and unreliable. In this talk, you'll learn about
Paired Benchmarking: a practical method for measuring algorithms' performance
side-by-side, under identical conditions, to get clearer, more trustworthy
results.

Denis Bazhenov has more than 15 years of experience designing and building
distributed systems in multiple languages, including Rust. He developed and
scaled an e-commerce search platform that grew by a factor of 500 over ten
years, balancing user experience demands with hardware cost constraints. His
work emphasizes system design, mechanical sympathy, performance optimization,
and software testability, with a deep interest in benchmarking techniques.
Outside of work, Denis enjoys skiing, snowboarding, kitesurfing, and reading.
