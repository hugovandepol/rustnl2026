Why would you want to make a game? Because it's fun! But a game is nothing more than a high-performance reactive interactive data visualisation. What you do with those capabilities is up to you!

Join us for a 4 hour workshop where we explore the Bevy game engine! We'll go through the process of creating an arcade game, starting with the Entity-Component-System (ECS) at Bevy's heart, and add features using Bevy building blocks until we have a full game.

Whether you're new to game development or looking to deepen your knowledge of Bevy's latest features, this workshop will cater to different skill levels by providing room for self-expression and time to experiment. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a basic Bevy project and understand its core architecture.
- Create and manage Entities, Components, and Systems, and the Bevy's extensions to the ECS model like queries, commands and observers.
- Handle user input, directly and using an input-action manager.
- Use the built-in rendering pipelines to render your game, and the different abstraction levels they offer.
- Load game assets and define your own custom formats.
- Add game "juice" with animations, audio and visual effects.
- Find and use third-party plugins, and benefit from Bevy extensibility.

Through a series of guided exercises, you'll incrementally build a game while learning best practices for structuring your code, debugging common issues, and leveraging Bevy's features.
