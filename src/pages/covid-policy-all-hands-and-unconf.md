To make sure that everyone who wants to can safely attend the All-Hands/Unconf,
including those who are immunocompromised,
we are taking extra covid safety precautions on Friday and Saturday.

## Testing

On all days of RustWeek, covid self-tests will be available for anyone who wants to test themselves.

On Friday and Saturday (at the All-Hands and Unconf), we expect <b>all attendees</b> to test themselves in the morning.

If you are able to pick up self-tests earlier in the week, please test yourself before coming to the venue.
If not, there will be self tests available at the door.

Covid infection rates have been very low lately, but in the unlikely case that you test positive,
please do not come to the venue or leave as soon as possible, to avoid infecting others.

Similarly, if you feel sick (regardless of any test result), please do not come to the venue.

## Masks

On all days of RustWeek, masks will be available for those who wish to make use of them.

## CO₂ meters

In every room at the All-Hands and Unconference, there wil be Aranet4 CO₂ meters to monitor the air quality.
These can help you decide whether to enter a room or not, or whether to open a window for more ventilation.
