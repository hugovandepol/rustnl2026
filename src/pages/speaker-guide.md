If you're looking at this page, we'd like to thank you for speaking at RustWeek 2025! As a speaker, you might have some questions about the conference. We're happy to answer any questions you have, but here are at least some frequently asked question you can look at.

If you have any questions not answered on this page, you can send an email to <jana@rustnl.org>.

## When am I speaking?

You can find the time of the talks in the [timetable](https://2025.rustnl.org/timetable/).

## How long should my talk be?

Depending on the time slot allocated for your talk, it should be 15 or 30 minutes.
After that time, we always scheduled a gap of 5 to 10 minutes for audience questions.

## Who should my talk be aimed at?

The goal is to target intermediate to advanced Rustaceans.
You can assume that everyone in the audience is at least familiar with Rust,
so there should be no need to explain basic properties of the language.

## What can I use for slides?

The easiest option is to send us a PDF with your slides beforehand. If you'd like to use another format, please let us know beforehand.

If you have any special requests, such as using your own laptop, live demoing, screencasting from a phone, or anything else,
please contact us well in advance of the conference so we can notify the venue as well.

Here are some additional factoids and tips:

- The aspect ratio of the main screen will be the standard 16:9.
- The laptop provided by the venue won't be connected to the internet, so if you provide a PDF or a PowerPoint file, make sure to embed all videos, fonts and other assets into the file.
- If you present from your own laptop make sure that we can connect an HDMI cable to it. If it does not have an HDMI port, please bring your own dongle.
- Even if you present from your own laptop, you can send us a PDF or similar format as backup.
- We don't need to approve your slides, but if you want feedback on them, for example to check whether they are a good fit for the expected audience, you send them to us.

## Will the talk be live streamed and recorded?

Yes. The talk will be live streamed and uploaded to YouTube after you've been given a chance to review the recording.
