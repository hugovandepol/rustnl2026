Hi, Iâ€™m Matthias Endler, a Rust developer and open-source maintainer with 20 years of experience in software development. I'm also the host of 'Rust in Production' podcast.

I help clients worldwide get the most out of Rust through training, consulting, and writing no-frills, easy-to-follow, idiomatic Rust code.
