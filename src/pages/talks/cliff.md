We all know Rust scales up, but what kind of resources do you need for Rust firmware in low-end embedded systems?

How about a couple of kilobytes in a US$0.50 microcontroller? This is not theoretical, it's shipping today.

Cliff has had the privilege of using Rust in his day job since 2018. He's the author of Learn Rust The Dangerous Way, an unsafe-first tutorial for C programmers. At his day job at Oxide Computer he's the original author of the Hubris high-reliability embedded operating system, used throughout Oxide's hardware. At night he builds microcontroller art projects using Rust and sells embedded widgets on Tindie/Lectronz. He is rarely on fire, and generally not for very long.
