We poked at rustc internals so you won't have to. In this talk I will present Charon, a tool that extracts the complete contents of a crate and its dependencies into an easy-to-use representation, for use in analysis and code generation tools.

Nadri has been contributing to the Rust compiler for 5 years, specializing in pattern-related features. When he's not doing Rust as a hobby, he does Rust at work, building Charon.
