Trait objects are everywhere in Rust, but do you know how they actually work? Join me as I re-implement trait objects from scratch, discovering their inner workings and all the smart design decisions that have been put into them.

//////

A nonbinary compiler engineer. Currently working on the rust compiler as a member of the [compiler team](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/compiler#team-compiler) (having worked on features like ""explicit tail calls"" and ""the never type"", among many other things) in my own time and on writing a proprietary rustc backend at tasking.com. I've also maintained a popular library for chat bots ([teloxide](https://lib.rs/crates/teloxide), 3.3k github stars) and co-created the [unfair rust quiz](https://this.quiz.is.fckn.gay).

I just ""do stuff"" and in the past 4 years, ""the stuff"" is mostly Rust.

The description for this field seem to imply that I should put something silly here too, not just the dry boring facts... I love hiking on mountains, both in Celeste (the critically acclaimed 2018 platformer) *and* in real life.
