Trait objects are everywhere in Rust, but how do they actually work? Join me as we implement vtables them from scratch, discovering how and why they work and how they handle edge cases.

//////

A nonbinary compiler engineer. Currently working on the rust compiler as a member of the [compiler team](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/compiler#team-compiler) (having worked on features like ""explicit tail calls"" and ""the never type"", among many other things) in my own time and on writing a proprietary rustc backend at tasking.com. I've also maintained a popular library for chat bots ([teloxide](https://lib.rs/crates/teloxide), 3.3k github stars) and co-created the [unfair rust quiz](https://this.quiz.is.fckn.gay).

I just ""do stuff"" and in the past 4 years, ""the stuff"" is mostly Rust.

The description for this field seem to imply that I should put something silly here too, not just the dry boring facts... I love hiking on mountains, both in Celeste (the critically acclaimed 2018 platformer) *and* in real life.
