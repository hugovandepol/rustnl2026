This talk will present a postmortem of the worst bug you can imagine happen for a bot which only feature is to post comics: The wrong comic being posted.

To explain the issue we will look at API's of various time and date libraries and how they differ.

////// <!-- sepatator between abstract and bio -->

I am a Rust engineer who have a large interest within the subject of programming languages, and especially the bit more niche subject of program transformation.

I have volunteered a lot in the past both for teaching and open source projects and I practically live inside of Emacs.
