Rust of today looks and feels quite different from Rust of 10+ years ago. When I started many of today's key features did not exist: stability, Cargo, crates.io, async, Tokio, MSVC integration, wasm integration, proc macros, project governance, conferences, production users, or a community-at-scale. What in the world could motivate someone to stick around so long until this all came into existence? I hope to convince you that I'm not a madman for still being here and also stick around for another 10 years of Rust. I know I plan to do so!

////// <!-- sepatator between abstract and bio -->

I'm a Rust team alumni who participated on a number of teams including Core, Cargo, Libs, and others. I contributed to Rust prior to it's 1.0 release in 2015 and the years afterwards. Nowadays I've shifted my focus to WebAssembly and primarily work on Wasmtime, an out-of-browser WebAssembly engine. I also help maintain the Rust and WebAssembly integration and targets.
