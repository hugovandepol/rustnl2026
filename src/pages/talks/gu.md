Rust makes embedded application development easier.

////// <!-- sepatator between abstract and bio -->

I am an LLM engineer working at Inftech.ai but enthusiastic to Rust and
embedding stuffs. I contributed to various embedded Rust projects and Iâ€™ve been
building RMK, a keyboard firmware written in Rust for about 2 years.
