////// <!-- sepatator between abstract and bio -->

Ralf Jung is an assistant professor at ETH Zurich working on formal
verification and formal foundations for real-world programming languages, with
a focus on Rust. He's doing research on Rust since 2015 and actively involved
in the Rust project since 2018 in various roles: as maintainer of Miri, as
co-lead of the operational semantics team, as language team advisor, and as a
compiler contributor and team member. His main goal is to give Rust a
mathematically formal official semantics that can be used for testing and
verification.
