            talkTitle="Xilem: let's build high performance Rust UI"
            talkAbstract="Xilem is a new UI toolkit designed for high performance and idiomatic expression of UI and app logic, suitable for both desktop and mobile. Xilem is built in a layered architecture. At the top is a reactive layer where views are simple statically typed Rust structs (though type erasure is possible), and no macros are needed. The widget layer is evolved from Druid. At the infrastructure layer is Vello, a 2D rendering engine using GPU compute shaders, specially tuned for dynamic vector graphics content. The text stack is also tuned for performance, including supporting animation of variable font parameters. Accessibility is a primary goal, and integration with AccessKit is baked in from the start. Another goal is interop with other projects in the Rust ecosystem, including wgpu, and providing a clean abstraction layer for widgets. It is work in progress, with a strong open source community driving toward ambitious goals."
            bio="Raph Levien is a research software engineer on the Google Fonts team, primarily working on GPU font rendering. He’s been actively involved in the Rust community for over seven years, and has worked on pulldown-cmark, the Druid UI toolkit, and other popular crates. He has a PhD from UC Berkeley on the topic of interactive curve editing, and has been involved in font creation and 2D graphics tools most of his career."

The talk will start with a general overview of recent work on rustls and then introduce rustls-libssl. We'll dive into some of the challenges Joe has encoutered, like 1) various depraved details of the openssl API that mad this project particularly challenging, 2) building a shared library from rust, with correctly versioned symbols, 3) writing rust emulatoins of your native dependencies so miri so it can run all your tests."

            talkAbstract="For Rust to really take off, we have a cycle to break: companies need Rust developers to start doing Rust, and developers need Rust jobs to start learning Rust.

            talkTitle="Fortifying Rust's FFI with Encapsulated Functions"
            talkAbstract="Memory- and type-safe languages like Rust are increasingly popular for systems development. Nonetheless, practical systems must interact with code written in memory-unsafe languages. Examples for this can be found across the spectrum, with many Rust applications linking against popular libraries such as OpenSSL, to security and safety-critical embedded systems, where subsystems such as cryptographic implementations are subject to industrial and governmental certification requirements. Direct interactions with such libraries, however, expose safe languages to significant risks: any single bug in either the foreign code or the cross-language interactions may arbitrarily violate the memory and/or type safety of the wrapping language. This talk presents Encapsulated Functions, an ongoing research project exploring how to secure cross-language interactions along with their differing guarantees and semantics around memory- and type-safety. At its core, Encapsulated Functions is a framework that combines memory protection mechanisms (such as the RISC-V Physical Memory Protection or Intel's Memory Protection Keys) with a set of portable types to both restrict and encapsulate behavior across the language boundary. Through the portability across different memory protection mechanisms we can utilize this infrastructure in both highly-restrictive embedded systems and applications running on conventional operating systems alike."

He is an active developer and maintainer of the Tock embedded operating system, written in Rust and designed to run mutually distrustful applications."

            talkAbstract="The PineTime is an affordable and functional smartwatch with open-source firmware. Although several open-source RTOSes are available to run on it, nothing feels better than creating your own firmware and running it every day. This talk presents my journey of creating this firmware, the tools I used, and the lessons learned. It demonstrates a real-world application using the Embassy project. The talk will go through the following topics, showing code snippets along the way, accompanied by live demonstration where it makes sense. * Initial background motivation for the project * Explaining the the different phases of the project * Handling firmware updates (how and why I did this early). * Driving the screen (which crates I used to do it) * Driving the external flash (how to write a driver with embedded-hal) * Bootstrapping from Infinitime, potentially bricking my pinetime. * Lessons learned, what I would do differently. * Wishlist, what I think would improve the developer experience."
