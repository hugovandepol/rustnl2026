In this workshop we will build an image viewer application in Makepad, explaining the core platform concepts needed to build applications. We will compile the application for Desktop, but also Web and mobile including iOS, Android and Harmony OS. 

Please refer to [github.com/makepad/makepad](https://github.com/makepad/makepad) where we will publish a list of dependencies 1 week prior to the workshop to install for the platforms you are interested in. iOS for instance needs an apple developer account.
