Diesel is a performant and type-safe query builder and ORM (object
relational mapper) for Rust.
In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how Diesel can be used to
build complex database-dependent applications.


Target Audience:

This workshop is designed for developers using Rust to develop software
that interacts with database system.
Participants are assumed to have at least basic Rust knowledge.


Contents:

All parts of the workshop are accompanied by hands-on exercises.
Participants will build their own
small web application as part of the workshop.

The workshop consists of the following different parts:

1. Introducing Diesel

As first step of our workshop, we will look at Diesel from a high level
point of view. You will setup
a small example application together to get a working environment for
the later stages of the workshop.

2. Explaining how the different CRUD statements work

In this part, we will explain how Diesel models Insert, Query, Update
and Delete statements.
You will extend our example application to perform each of these
operations. As part of this step you will
see which of the offered options for each operation should be used in
which use-case.

3. Diesel-Async and when you should use it

Here we will discuss the differences between the regular `diesel` crate
and the `diesel-async` crate.
You will learn how they interact with each other, what the advantages
and disadvantages of each crate are and when to use one or the other.

Prerequisites:

The workshop material will be shared publicly before the workshop.
Participants are expected to bring their own laptop with a working
Rust development setup.

Notes:

The workshop materials (slides for the talk, starting points for the
exercises) will be shared beforehand in a GitHub repository.
This repository will also be used to publish the solutions to the
exercises during the workshop.
