The goal of the workshop is to start from scratch with Bevy, go though the basis in theory, see how it can be used, and then dig deeper into each part and how they work with each other to make a game. Depending on the focus of the workshop, it’s possible to go deeper into Bevy, or to see how it’s possible to build a Rust game for native, for Wasm and for mobile (Android or iOS depending on attendees phone of choice).
