After an introduction to Bevy, attendees will be able to select a starter kit for a Bevy game, then we'll look at finishing it.

Attendees should be able to leave with a game that run natively on their laptop, in Wasm on their browser, and if all goes well as a game on their mobile phone too.

LEVEL: Intermediate
