We're excited to welcome everyone at RustNL 2024! However, to ensure everyone's safety, we're following the guidelines of the Dutch government regarding COVID-19. Additionally, we'd like participants to adhere to the following, such that the event is safe and comfortable for everyone:

- If you've tested positive, or feel sick, we would like to ask you to stay home. You can still follow all the awesome talks on our livestream! There will be self-tests and masks available at the venue.
- Please be respectful of people that would like to socialize at a distance.
- We will provide outdoors, well-ventilated spaces for socializing safely.
