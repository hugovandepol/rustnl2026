            <p>
            On Wednesday, the second day of the RustWeek 2025 conference,
            there will be a dedicated room for the "Rust Project track".
            </p>
            <p>
            Team members are giving talks as part of this track that are mainly relevant
            to Rust project members and contributors.
            See <a href="https://rustweek.org/schedule/wednesday/">the Wednesday conference schedule</a> for an overview of the talks.
            </p>
            <p>
            To attend the conference, you'll need a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/rust-week-2025-tickets-1001676961757?aff=oddtdtcreator">conference ticket</a>.
            If your employer is unable to pay for your ticket, please request a sponsored ticket from the Rust Foundation through grants@rustfoundation.org.

            <p>
            The day before the all-hands, we will have some time to relax at a fun and informal "pre-all-hands" day.
            This takes place at the same <a href="/dus">venue</a> as the all-hands.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you do feel the urge to do anything productive on this day, there will be plenty of rooms to work or collaborate with others.
            For everyone else, there will be board games, Lego, outdoor games, and plenty of other team members to hang out with.
            </p>
            <p>
            You don't need a separate ticket for the Pre-All-Hands.

            <h2>Celebration (Thursday afternoon)</h2>
            <p>
            At the same venue, in the afternoon and evening, we will be celebrating the 10th birthday of Rust 1.0
            together with Rust project alumni, Rust users, and sponsors.
            </p>
            <p>
            Rust's 10th birthday happens to fall exactly on the same day as the release of Rust 1.87.0,
            which will happen live on stage.
            </p>
            <p>
            All attendees of the Rust All-Hands are also invited to the celebration.
            We will ask you to confirm your attendance at a later point in time.

            Other than that, each team or topic will have its own room.
            </p>
            <p>
            In total, we will have 12 rooms available to us. See <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G07-f2pwAzEztZMpuxcCW3EWFS1pEX4ShNbsg91Qqjw/edit?gid=0#gid=0">the schedule</a> for details.
            </p>
            <p>
            Each room will have tables made out of cardboard that you can write on and a whiteboard and/or flipover.
            Most rooms will have a large HDMI screen as well.

            <h2>Co-located Unconference</h2>
            <p>
            At the same venue, in the other wing of the same building,
            there will be a parallel event: an unconference for Rust maintainers.
            This unconference will include rooms for Rust for Linux, Bevy, UI/app development, the embedded working group, and more (TBD).
            </p>
            <p>
            This provides a great opportunity for collaboration.
            You can invite potential users to your discussions about new Rust features,
            or you can ask to join one of the maintainer rooms to hear about their Rust needs.
