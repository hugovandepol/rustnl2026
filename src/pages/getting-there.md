Our main venue is [**Kinepolis Jaarbeurs Utrecht**][1]. As the name implies,
this is in the beautiful (and very well-connected) city of [Utrecht](/#where).

As you plan your trip, it is important to remember that The Netherlands is
very dense and that traveling between cities is easy by train. For
example, flying to Amsterdam and staying in a hotel in Hilversum is not a
problem!
