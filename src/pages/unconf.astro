            <h2>Celebration (Thursday afternoon)</h2>
            <p>
            At the unconf venue, in the afternoon and evening, we will be celebrating the 10th birthday of Rust 1.0
            together with Rust project members, Rust project alumni, Rust users, and sponsors. All participants of the unconf are welcome to join the party.
            </p>
            <p>
            Rust's 10th birthday happens to fall exactly on the same day as the release of Rust 1.87.0,
            which will happen live on stage.
            </p>
            <p>
            To attend the celebration, you'll need a ticket.
            Tickets will be free for all attendees of the RustWeek unconf.
            (More info later.)

            <h2>Unconf (Friday and Saturday)</h2>
            <p>
            The RustWeek unconf will begin on Friday.
            Other than a quick plenary start of the unconf, each unconf group will have their own schedule
            and their own dedicated room.
            </p>
            <p>
            RustNL, the organizer of RustWeek, will coordinate with your group about the schedules and room assignments in advance,
            and can help to create opportunities for collaboration between your group, other unconf groups and Rust project teams.
            </p>
            <p>
            Of course, the group itself (not RustNL) decides on participants and its topics on the two unconf days. What needs to be coordinated with RustNL is the maximum size of the group and other logistics. For question the contact person of your group can reach to Erik via erik@rustnl.org.
            </p>
            <p>
            Each unconf group will have a main room and a breakout room. The room will have tables made out of cardboard that you can write on,
            a whiteboard and/or flipover, and a large HDMI screen.

            <h2>Co-located Rust project All-Hands</h2>
            <p>
            At the same venue, in the other wing of the same building,
            there will be a parallel event: the Rust project All-Hands.      
            </p>
            <p>
            This provides a great opportunity for collaboration. You can invite Rust project members to hear about your Rust needs, 
            or you can ask to join one of the project team rooms to take part in discussion about relevant new Rust features for your group.

                The venue has 20+ airconditioned rooms, of which 10 are reserved for the unconf. For lunch and socializing there are big inside (~350p) and outside areas.
