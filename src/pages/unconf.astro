                RustWeek 2025 includes social activities organised by and for

            <h2 id="conf">Conference (Tue + Wed)</h2>
            <p>
                The 2-day conference is held next to the Utrecht Central Station
                at Kinepolis Jaarbeurs (not the same venue as the unconf!), on
                Tuesday and Wednesday.
            </p>
            <p>
                On Tuesday one of the tracks, the Ecosystem track, has one
                reserved talk for each unconf group. The group can suggest a
                talk, which can be any topic. It could be a deep-dive
                functioning as a warm-up for discussions at the unconf or a talk
                about how to join your community and start contributing.
            </p>
            <h2 id="celebration">Celebration (Thursday afternoon)</h2>
            <p>
                At the unconf venue, in the afternoon and evening, we will be
                celebrating the 10th birthday of Rust 1.0 together with Rust
                project members, Rust project alumni, Rust users, and sponsors.
                All participants of the unconf are welcome to join the party.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rust's 10th birthday happens to fall exactly on the same day as
                the release of Rust 1.87.0, which will happen live on stage.
            </p>
            <p>
                To attend the celebration, you'll need a ticket. Tickets will be
                free for all attendees of the RustWeek unconf. (More info
                later.)
            </p>
            <h2 id="unconf-details">Unconf (Friday and Saturday)</h2>
            <p>
                The RustWeek unconf will begin on Friday. Other than a quick
                plenary start of the unconf, each unconf group will have their
                own schedule and their own dedicated room.
            </p>
            <p>
                RustNL, the organizer of RustWeek, will coordinate with your
                group about the schedules and room assignments in advance, and
                can help to create opportunities for collaboration between your
                group, other unconf groups and Rust project teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, the group itself (not RustNL) decides on participants
                and its topics on the two unconf days. What needs to be
                coordinated with RustNL is the maximum size of the group and
                other logistics. For questions, the contact person of your group
                can reach to Erik via erik@rustnl.org.

            <h2>Co-located Rust project All-Hands</h2>
            <p>
                At the same venue, in the other wing of the same building, there
                will be a parallel event: the Rust project All-Hands.
            </p>
            <p>
                This provides a great opportunity for collaboration. You can
                invite Rust project members to hear about your Rust needs, or
                you can ask to join one of the project team rooms to take part
                in discussion about relevant new Rust features for your group.
            </p>
            <h2 id="rooms">Rooms</h2>
            <p>
                The venue has 20+ airconditioned rooms, of which 10 are reserved
                for the unconf. For lunch and socializing there are big inside
                (~350p) and outside areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each unconf group will have a main room and a breakout room. The
                room will have tables made out of cardboard that you can write
                on, a whiteboard and/or flipover, and a large HDMI screen.
