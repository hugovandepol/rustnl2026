The RustWeek 2025 conference will be held in [**Kinepolis Jaarbeurs Utrecht**](https://kinepolis.nl/bioscopen/kinepolis-jaarbeurs-utrecht/info/). This venue is a cinema in the center of Utrecht, right next to the Central Station.

Note: please keep in mind that the workshops (<b>Thursday 15 May</b>) are not held in the conference venue, but in the second venue, called DUS. See [the week schedule](/#schedule).

Check out [this page](getting-there) for instructions for getting to the venue.

## Accessibility

The venue is fully accessible by wheelchair. Every room has wheelchair spaces. There are also elevators to every room that is part of the conference. Accessible toilets are also present.

## Conference rooms

The talks will be held in cinema rooms, which has a couple of amazing features. First, a massive cinema-grade screen will make it easy to follow the talks from anywhere in the room. Second, the seats are some of the most comfortable you'll ever encounter at a conference.

## Socializing

The catering area, called Speys, is a huge space; perfect for eating and socializing, and hosting our sponsor's booths. It allows for 1200 people, which is more than enough for the 800 attendees we hope to welcome. There will seats, tables and power outlets for everyone to talk, code and hang out. Lunch, snacks, and drinks are, of course, included with your ticket.
