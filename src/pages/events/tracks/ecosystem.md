The Ecosystem track hosts a mix of talks by selected communities in the Rust ecosystem, selected by each [unconf](/unconf-intro) group (e.g. Bevy Engine and Rust Embedded Working Group).

In addition, the **GOSIM Spotlight** offers early-stage Rust projects a unique opportunity to shine at RustWeek 2025 and present their work. Finalists will receive travel grant to attend the RustWeek conference.
