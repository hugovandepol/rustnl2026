The Ecosystem track hosts a mix of talks by selected communities in the Rust ecosystem, selected by each [unconf](/unconf-intro) group (e.g. Bevy Engine and Rust Embedded Working Group).

The **GOSIM Spotlight** offers early-stage Rust projects a unique opportunity to shine at RustWeek 2025. 

The GOSIM finalists will receive a travel grant to attend the RustWeek conference, present their work in a lightning talk in the Ecosystem track, and host their demo booths where you can come meet them. See the "GOSIM Spotlight tables" section below.

You can find all GOSIM finalist on the [GOSIM Spotlight speaker page](/gosim-spotlight-speakers).
