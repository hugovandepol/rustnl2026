If you are in town already on Monday you can come by the conference venue and pick up your conference badge. The pre-registration is from 11:00 to 14:00.

Pre-registration is optional; you can also register on Tuesday morning, starting 8:30. If you pre-register you can skip the line on Tuesday.

On Monday afternoon we have scheduled social activities, check them out [here](/events/social-activities).
