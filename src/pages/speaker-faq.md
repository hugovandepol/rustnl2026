If you're looking at this page, we'd like to thank you for speaking at RustNL 2024! As a speaker, you might have some questions about the conference. We're happy to answer any questions you have, but here are at least some frequently asked question you can look at.

## When am I speaking?

You can find the time of the talks in the [schedule](https://2024.rustnl.org/schedule/).

## How long should my talk be?

Depending on the time slot allocated for your talk, it should be 15 or 30 minutes. This is excluding 5-10 min questions.

## Who should my talk be aimed at?

The goal is to intermediate/advanced Rustaceans, but if your talk targets beginners that's fine too. You can assume that the audience is familiar with Rust.

## What can I use for slides?

The easiest option is to send us a PDF with your slides beforehand. If you'd like to use another format, please let us know beforehand.

If you have any special requests, such as using your own laptop, live demoing, screencasting from a phone, or anything else, please contact Terts well in advance of the conference. The venue is experienced in handling complex setups, but they do need to know what they have to arrange.

## Will the talk be live streamed and recorded?

Yes. The talk will be live streamed to Vimeo and uploaded to YouTube after you've been given a chance to review the recording.

## Who can I contact if I have more questions?

You can find more general information about the conference on the pages about [accessibility](insert_link), [getting there](insert_link) and the [code of conduct](insert_link)
