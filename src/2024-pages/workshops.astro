                            This workshop is focused on setting up
                            communications between a host PC and an embedded
                            system. Having the skills to do this quickly and
                            reliably can help your next project, whether you are
                            starting a project that requires heavy interaction
                            with a host PC, or setting up a testing interface
                            for triggering hardware events, or building tooling
                            to make it easier to see what your system is doing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            James will explain the different crates that can be
                            used, how they fit together, and techniques +
                            recipes for solving a number of common challenges.
                            You'll build your own communication link over USB to
                            a microcontroller. This workshop is best suited to
                            developers that are comfortable writing and running
                            Rust on `no_std` microcontrollers already,
                            particularly using the `embassy` framework. You will
                            be provided working projects to start from, and will
                            be expected to customize and extend them to achieve
                            the different goals of the workshop.

                            This workshop is led by James Munns of OneVariable
                            UG. James is the author of the `postcard` crate, and
                            has built dozens of PC-to-MCU links like these for
                            client projects over the past years.

                            In this workshop we will use a small RiscV
                            microcontroller (ESP32C3, provided by the workshop)
                            to build a connectionless chat application running
                            on your PC written with the Makepad UI library. We
                            will be using the ESP NOW protocol, an IOT protocol
                            that allows you to send and receive messages without
                            being connected to a wifi hotspot. The Rust
                            toolchain and libraries needed to program this MCU
                            are available directly from cargo and crates io, as
                            well as makepad studio and framework. We will use
                            Makepad Studio to write both the MCU program and the
                            chat UI that connects to the ESP32 over USB serial
                            and thus allows sending and receiving these messages
                            from the local space. At end we will hopefully have
                            a working local (lossy) chatroom.

                            Are you a happy Rust developer, who cannot wait but
                            struggles to introduce Rust at their day job? Is the
                            fear of working with foreign code keeping your team
                            from getting to work with your favourite programming
                            language? This workshop is for you!

                            In the Mix-in-Rust, you'll get the tools and
                            know-how to introduce Rust in your current, non-rust
                            projects. We'll go over the hardships of FFI, the
                            way Rust tackles them, and what tooling is out there
                            to make Rust speak other langauges.

                            basic knowledge of C. Basically, you should know

                            Your Rust application has finally been deployed to
                            production! Nice! But is it working? This workshop
                            will show you how the tracing crate can be leveraged
                            to instrument your application and make sure you
                            have enough information to diagnose issues when they
                            occur.

                            This workshop is designed for developers operating
                            Rust services in production-like environments or
                            preparing to do so.

                            An introduction to the tracing instrumentation
                            library, covering both how to instrument your code
                            (capturing fields, log levels, macros) and how to
                            process the resulting telemetry data in your
                            application (subscriber configuration, logging
                            levels, log filtering). We'll also touch on how
                            tracing integrates with OpenTelemetry.
                        </p>
