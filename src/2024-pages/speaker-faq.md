If you're looking at this page, we'd like to thank you for speaking at RustWeek 2025! As a speaker, you might have some questions about the conference. We're happy to answer any questions you have, but here are at least some frequently asked question you can look at.

## When am I speaking?

You can find the time of the talks in the [schedule](https://2025.rustnl.org/schedule/).

## How long should my talk be?

Depending on the time slot allocated for your talk, it should be 15 or 30 minutes. This is excluding 5-10 min questions.

## Who should my talk be aimed at?

The goal is to target intermediate/advanced Rustaceans, but if your talk targets beginners that's fine too. You can assume that the audience is familiar with Rust.

## What can I use for slides?

The easiest option is to send us a PDF with your slides beforehand. If you'd like to use another format, please let us know beforehand.

If you have any special requests, such as using your own laptop, live demoing, screencasting from a phone, or anything else, please contact Terts well in advance of the conference. The venue is experienced in handling complex setups, but they do need to know what they have to arrange.

Here are some additional factoids and tips:

- The aspect ratio of the main screen will be the standard 16:9. There is also an additional screen on each side. If you want something to be displayed there, feel free to ask.
- The laptop provided by the venue won't be connected to the internet, so if you provide a PDF or a PowerPoint file, make sure to embed all videos, fonts and other assets into the file.
- If you present from your own laptop make sure that we can connect an HDMI cable to it. If it does not have an HDMI port, please bring your own dongle.
- Even if you present from your own laptop you can send us a PDF or similar format as backup.
- We don't need to approve your slides, but if you want feedback on them, for example to check whether they are a good fit for the expected audience, you send them to us.

## Will the talk be live streamed and recorded?

Yes. The talk will be live streamed to Vimeo and uploaded to YouTube after you've been given a chance to review the recording.

## Who can I contact if I have more questions?

You can find more general information about the conference on the pages about [accessibility](/accessibility), the [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct) and the rest of this website.

You can send Terts an email at terts.diepraam@gmail.com.
